Please implement the following feature request:

**Feature Request:** Initial app implementation: Create a clock app without subscribe  dev

**Project Context:**
- Repository: volter-ai/simple-clock-app-3
- Branch: feat/initial-implementation
- Base Branch: main
- Requested by: volter-ai

**CRITICAL - Read Project Instructions First:**
1. Check if there is a CLAUDE.md file in the repository root
2. If CLAUDE.md exists, READ IT FIRST and follow ALL guidelines specified there
3. The CLAUDE.md file contains critical project-specific instructions, architecture details, and conventions
4. All implementation decisions should follow the patterns and guidelines in CLAUDE.md

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Read CLAUDE.md if it exists (this is mandatory!)
2. Analyze the existing codebase structure and patterns (check existing components, styling approach, state management)
3. Implement the feature following the project's conventions from CLAUDE.md
4. If you need to add dependencies, update package.json accordingly
5. Ensure the code compiles and follows best practices
6. Make minimal, focused changes that accomplish the feature request

**Frontend/UI Implementation Best Practices:**
When implementing UI features, pages, or components:

- **Layout & Spacing:**
  - Use fullscreen layouts when appropriate (min-h-screen, w-full, h-full)
  - Implement proper responsive design with mobile-first approach
  - Use consistent spacing (padding, margin) following the project's design system
  - Utilize flexbox/grid for layouts (flex, grid, gap utilities)

- **Styling & Visual Design:**
  - Follow the existing styling approach (CSS Modules, Tailwind, styled-components, etc.)
  - Maintain consistent color palette and theming from existing components
  - Add smooth transitions and hover states for interactive elements
  - Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum)
  - Use semantic color names (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)

- **Component Architecture:**
  - Create reusable, composable components
  - Separate presentation from business logic
  - Use TypeScript interfaces for all component props
  - Implement proper loading states, error boundaries, and empty states
  - Follow existing file structure and naming conventions

- **User Experience:**
  - Add loading spinners or skeletons for async operations
  - Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Provide visual feedback for user actions (button states, form validation)
  - Ensure keyboard navigation and focus management
  - Add appropriate aria-labels for accessibility

- **Modern UI Patterns:**
  - Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for complex layouts
  - Implement proper z-index layering for modals, dropdowns, tooltips
  - Add smooth animations (transform, opacity) not layout shifts
  - Use CSS variables for theming support
  - Implement dark mode support if the project has it

- **Performance:**
  - Lazy load components when appropriate
  - Optimize images (proper formats, sizes, lazy loading)
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders (useMemo, useCallback, React.memo)
  - Use code splitting for large features

**Important Quality Checks:**
- CLAUDE.md is your primary source of truth for this project
- Always assume environment variables are available, and never leave situations where env vars are needed as mocked or TODO or placeholders. Environment variables are always there.
- Ensure all changes are production-ready and fully functional
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Verify responsive behavior across screen sizes
- Do not make unnecessary changes outside the feature scope
- Match the quality and style of existing components

Start by reading CLAUDE.md (if present), then implement the feature with professional-grade UI/UX.
